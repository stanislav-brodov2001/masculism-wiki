Incel, patriarchal and right-wing ideas are not only trash for everyone, but even controversial with men's rights: you cannot say that men are valuable and say, that they are in addictive need of sex (like incels do), must do all the work (like patriarchs do) or must be hated for being gay or black (like rights do). But sometimes men's rights \"activists\" unfortunately are incels or tradcons, yes. Let's smash those dummies together.","Armies","Suicides","Torture","Genocides","Police brutality","Gayphobia and transphobia","Difference in average life expectancy","Homicides","Homelessness","Rapes","Domestic violence","Mortality","Shitty feminist activism","Childhood","Health","Fathers' rights","Media","Shall I continue?","No. The data tells us, that men are also vulnerable, and if you are intellectually honest, you cannot really argue against that.","No. Men do have privileges and vulnerabilities. And women have own vulnerabilities and own privileges. It's that simple.","\"Patriarchy has no gender\" — Bell HooksFeminist Gayle Rubin has wrote in her \"The Traffic in Women\", that the patriarchal system is system of absolute power of fathers (patriarchs) — eg. biblical character Abraham was a patriarch. Patriarch can rape, sell or kill \"his\" women and children without punishment. So today we are not living in patriarchy just starting with the fact that a man is punished for raping and killing a woman. Continuing further, while governments are indeed more often filled with men, the governments almost never do any decisions that are beneficial for men as a group. As we've seen above, men are absolutely not privileged or \"beneficiaries of the current system\". If men had some huge power over the world, first of all they would have stopped to force themselves to die in wars.Thirdly, system gives own vulnerabilities and privileges for both men and women (and none to non-binaries by their correct gender, lol).","Sex/gender-system or gender-system ●This option was suggested by Gayle Rubin.Kyriarchy ●In feminist theory, kyriarchy is a social system or set of connecting social systems built around domination, oppression, and submission. If patriarchy means \"fathers power\", kyriarchy means \"masters power\" or \"rulers power\". So, basically, by kyriarchy privileged ones are the people who sit in governments or big businesses, are they men or women.??? ●If you have another option, suggest it to me and I'll add it here!","Matriarchy ⚬The system does not give women enough power or benefits to call them privileged.Vaginacapitalism ⚬What????But talking seriously, this one is synonym to patriarchy: women can get benefits with sex -> having sex with mostly heterosexual men -> men are still in power, it's just easier for women to take a \"social lift\" to higher levels than for men by selling themselves. Which may be true somehow, but it's weird as fuck to build whole political theory on this, and it is also absolutely not about fighting for men.","No, not only by them.IPV violence:- Huge systematic review of 62 different studies has came to conclusion that \"Female- perpetrated IPV is a common occurrence among adolescents, college students, and adults\" in heterosexual relationships.- Another meta-analysis of close to 100 studies, found that in heterosexual intimate relationships, women are even slightly more likely to use physical violence against a partner and to use violence more frequently than men.Sexual violence:- A 2008 study of 98 men interviewed on the United States National Crime Victimization Survey found that nearly half of the men (46%) who reported some form of sexual victimization were victimized by women.- CDC USA 2010 and 2012 studies both found out, that 40.5% of all heterosexual rapists are women. [?]","Childhood:- Majority of the perpetrators of child abuse/neglect today are mothers (53.5% vs 45.3%).- Women perpetrators involved in 45% of child molestations (22% female-only perpetrator + 23% both male and female perpetrators)Wars:- Women also start wars, where only men are forced to die.- Between 1480 and 1913, queens were 27% more likely to start wars than kings.And so on.Even if men were oppressed only by other men, it would be egregious cruelty to oppose the men's rights activism just because of this. (Note that the data above doesn't say, that men cannot be bad or that all women are bad, but just that some women can also be bad — what a discovery!)","If one's ideology (eg. homophobia, racism or men-hating feminism) goes against the scientifical facts, it's time to change the ideology (or acknowledge that you're a bigot). But I believe, that the idea of women being discriminated by men is wrong by itself. Women and men are discriminated by sex/gender-system, not one by another, just like gays and lesbians are discriminated by heteronormative system, not by heterosexuals exclusively. And here we can agree: discrimination \"backwards\" — i.e. discrimination of those, who are in power, by ordinary women and men — does not exist.(When I say \"those in power\", I mean presidents and political/business elites, not jews.)","No. The idea of men's rights activism is about \"men are also vulnerable\", not \"women aren't\". Women still have their own issues: eg. abortion rights, abuse in prostitution & pornography, transwomen issues, majority of sexual violence, education in group of countries, androcentrism in languages and others, that deserve to be fixed.","The egalitarian fight for men's rights is usually called masculism.The fight for patriarchy or antifeminist struggle is usually called masculinism.They are sometimes mixed, because men's rights theme isn't popular yet. Stick with masculism, to confidently expropriate the term to the left-wing side.In case you want to stay neutral as much as possible, you can always say \"men's rights advocacy\" or \"men's rights activism\".","No. White and heterosexual males and females are indeed privileged: there is no law against white skin color or heterosexual orientation; there is no country where being heterosexual is illegal; there is no much more killed heteros or whites than black and gays. It will be ridiculous to argue against that.","No, because it still talks just about men (who unquestionably do have problems), not against women. Compare: transgender activism is not a \"reactionary answer to feminism from men\" (as TERFs say) to somehow \"fight against\" women, it is about basic human rights.","Yes and no. In theory — yes, it fights for equality of women and men. But in practice feminism barely does anything for men. And it is OK, because feminism is about women's rights: it shouldn't necessarily fight for men just like ecoactivists shouldn't necessarily fight against racism (however you can be ecoactivist and antiracist). But we need a separated movement, which will focus on men's rights, so we can approach the gender inequality from both sides: making woman equal to man and man equal to woman. It would be also amazing for feminism, masculism and enby-activism to cooperate in fight.","Yes, and that's the very point of masculism: it tells us, that armies, police brutality, suicides and etc is a system, not unrelated series of events. You cannot deny, that every man is for example systematically forced to serve.","On the one hand: definitely wont. If intersectional feminism doesn't think that simultaneously fighting against homophobia, racism, transphobia, ableism, and so on will get in the way, then it shouldn't think that adding misandry to the \"fight against\"-list will break everything. If you're a TEFR, well, you're out of luck.","On the other hand, worrying about not antifeminist men's rights movement gonna harm women may mean that one is afraid of losing their monopoly on the position of victim by recognizing that men can be victims too. One should overcome it.","Indeed, today's system indisputably does teach men toxic masculinity, which is a problem. But I am fed up with those, who reduce the whole problem to just and only toxic masculinity. In worst case — huge left-wing super-inclusive \"against every discrimination\" festivals tell me, that \"men's discrimination doesn't exist\", because \"(cis)men aren't vulnerable, they oppress other people all over the world\", but \"(cis)men also suffer from patriarchy, in the way they are educated to deal with emotions :((\". This agenda is often said implying that \"men are benefiters of the system, but even for them it has some little flaws\". That is not true: men are farly not benefiters, and system does discriminate men enormously. So overall I am more against that agenda, than for it.","The same what you should think about \"all blacks are murderers\" or \"all gays are pedophiles\". Some blacks are murderers (0.01% in USA), some gays are pedophiles (0-3% worldwide), some men are rapists (0.06% in USA).This slogan also spreads useless fear of men: eg. every third woman worries about being sexually assaulted, despite 0.9% being victims of assault in past 12 months. (On the other side, it's possible that the rate of assaults is low precisely because women are massively \"prepared\" to it.)","Then you agree with me.Respect men's rights, support cooperation between feminists & masculists, do not start a competition about who is oppressed more or struggle for hegemony of feminism in gender-equality front."],"h4":[],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["No! Men's rights are for men, not against women. Many men's rights activists are also feminists themselves.","Only men are forced to serve in the military forces. During the wars, when there is a scarcity of troops, young boys are dispatched to the frontlines even before adult women. What if every woman was forced by the law to eg. give birth just based on the sex assigned at birth?","Males commit suicide 3-6 times more frequently than females - that is 6 men a day. But perhaps the issue isn't rooted in toxic masculinity at all: nearly all (91%) middle-aged men had been in contact with at least one frontline service or agency, primarily primary care services.","After a year of war in Ukraine OHCHR has documented 621 cases of enforced disappearances — 544 men, 71 women, 6 boys, 0 girls. 90% who was been abducted by Russia experienced torture. In Ukraine the rate was 50%.","If torture in a country is possible, men are much more vulnerable to it than women.","Genocides of Armenians, Indians, Syrians, Rwandans, Gypsies; massacre in Bucha, Srebrengica, Yugoslavia, Mexico, Iraqi Kurdistan and many other places — all were focused mostly or almost entirely on males. “Women and children are free [from being killed]. We are soldiers, not cowards to kill them\" - The Rape of Bangladesh","The US police are more than twice as likely to kill a black person than a white, and more than 23 times more likely to kill a man than a woman. Over 95% of killed by police were men. Police violence is primarily a gender issue, and only then the racial one.The situation goes almost insane, when we consider black men.","They don't care what gender or sex you are - as long as they decide you're a man. In Brazil during 2016-2020 were killed at least 760 transfeminine & at least 40 transmasculine people, at least 800 gay men & at least 150 lesbians, at least 30 heterosexuals mistaken for gay men. In other words, 90% of killed gays & transgenders are AMAB.There are also 34 countries, where only gay males are punished/executed, and 0 countries with gender-mirrored situation.","In poorly gender-equal countries like Russia, men live on average 10 years shorter than women. No, the reason is not in biology: the difference in life expectancy in healthier countries - for example, Sweden or Norway - is 3.4 years, in the Netherlands - 3.1 years. At the same time, men retire five years later than women.","When every fifth person killed worldwide is a woman - you call it femicide. Will you dare to fight against androcide, when 4 out of 5 killed are men? In Brazil every 14 out of 15 killed are men. Check other countries data here.","Men are 80% of homeless in Russia and 60% of homeless in USA.","Women, indeed, experience the majority of sexual violence. However, men and boys 1) Experience it too (at least 1 in 6 men)","2) Are raped not only by other men, but also by other women","3) Have have almost no crisis centers, assistance programs and else that exisst for female rape survivors. In some countries (eg. UK, India or Russia) it is currently not even legally possible for a woman to rape a man.","One in three victims of family violence is male. But male victims receive less than 0.05% of emergency shelter or transitional housing assistance.","Police officers also refuse to press charges against women perpetrators 3x more often than against men perpetrators. Women who nevertheless were charged in medium- and high-injury cases are even less likely to be taken into custody than men in NO-INJURY cases.","Risk of death for men is 60% higher than for women. 92% of workplace fatalities are men.","Men have also 2.8x more chance to die from alcohol-induced and 1.6x more from drug-induced causes.","Sometimes feminism does more harm than good. For example, one feminist group has bullied, harassed, threatened with death, threatened with bombs, and killed the dog of another feminist, founder of the women's shelter movement, because she asserted that women, too, perpetrate partner violence.","Another example: Suzanne Steinmetz and her family have also received verbal threats (both in public and at home), threatening phone calls, and bomb threats because she was one of the first researchers to bring up \"battered husbands.\"","Boys have similar chance to experience child abuse than girls (47.3% and 50.7%), but are 1.5x more likely to die of maltreatment. Parents also punish boys more (and more quickly) than they do girls. At the very end, no girl will be sent to war, forced to join terrorist group or suicide squad.","Of the top 15 leading causes of death, men lead in 12, are tied in 2, & trail in 1. Men are also majority (90%) of deadliest (highest number of deaths & highest mortality rate) cancers That perhaps happens because AMAB-specific cancer treatment funding is 3x lower than AFAB-specific.","64% of those newly recognized as disabled at working age in Russia are men.","4 in 5 custodial parents are mothers. Custodial fathers are less likely to get a child support. 74.3% of custodial fathers hold full-time jobs (compared to 51.4% of custodial mothers).92% of parents in prison are fathers. Some countries (eg. Russia) currently even cannot legally incarcerate mother, if she has a child under 14.","\"The ship with migrants sank. There were many people on it, including women and children…\"","Males are considered \"unworthy\" victims: un(der)reported in news outlets, suffering minimized, ignored, or sanitized. On the other hand, some studies say that more than 75% of representations of men or male identity in mass media show men as one of the following: villains, aggressors, perverts, philanderers.","Thank you.
